No. The Bible says Jesus had compassion2 on them for He saw them as sheep without a shepherd. They were like lost sheep, lost in their sin. How the Lord Jesus loved them! He knew they were helpless and needed a shepherd. And the Good Shepherd knew He had come to help them. But not just the people way back then. For the Lord Jesus knows all about you, and loves you too, and wants to help you.
